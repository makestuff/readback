This example provides an easy read/write interface to an SDRAM via a pair of
8-bit FIFOs. The host writes commands and write-data to the cmd_fifo and reads
read-data from the rsp_fifo.

The commands are always 16-bit word-aligned look like this:

  CCDD DDDD DDDD DDDD <args>

Where CC:

  00 -> Update pointer with these 14 bits D and the following 16-bits, giving
        a maximum pointer width of 30 bits

  01 -> Read a block of 16-bit words N given by the 14 bits D and the following
        16 bits (max block size 2^30). Subsequently, 2N data bytes need to be
        read from rsp_fifo.

  10 -> Write a block of 16-bit words N given by the 14 bits D and the following
        16 bits (max block size 2^30). Subsequently, 2N data bytes need to be
        written to cmd_fifo.
